Collect data from a Watterkotte Resümat CD4 controller for heatpumps and pulish it through MQTT in
a homeassistant friendly format.

Install: 
* Download or clone 
* pip3 install -r requirements.txt
* Change values in config.py according to your needs
* run python3 main.py
Install as service (optional)
* In resumatCD4-datacollector.service set WorkingDirectory= to the path of this project
* In file email-service-status-to-me@.service you can set an email address to receive errors on failure of the systemd service (default $USER@localhost)
* Copy the .service files to /etc/systemd/system/
* systemctl start resumatCD4-datacollector.service

Tested with ResümatCD4 version 8125. Software version 7000, 8000 and 8011 need different attribute addresses. See mwllgr's project.
The attributes are defined in ResumatCD4::attributes (resumatcd4.py). There you can change names and polling intervalls and define new attributes.
The set of attributes which get collected is defined in variable attributes in main.py.


MQTT Topics: 
  * heizung/<attr_id>
  * homeassistant/sensor/<attr_id>/config
